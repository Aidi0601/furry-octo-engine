There is a very old village at the small island called popocaca. A furry bear, bobola, is a teacher at the local school. One day, the fifth graders were having a sports party. Of course, they were all Cubs and Bears fans.  At this party, they made baseball decorated cupcakes and had a football-shaped pie.  All of the bears had a great time. However, the day was ruined when later that night the Bears were defeated by the Packers.

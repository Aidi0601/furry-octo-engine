There is a very old village at the small island called popocaca. A furry bear, bobola, is a teacher at the local school. One day, the fifth graders were having a sports party. Of course, they were all Cubs and Bears fans.  At this party, they made baseball decorated cupcakes and had a football-shaped pie.  All of the bears had a great time. However, the day was ruined when later that night the Bears were defeated by the Packers.
The bears were so mad that they decided to take a boat to Wisconsin and burn all the cheese! The Packers, without their cheese, starved to death. The Bears, finally victorious, danced on the graves of their now-dead rivals. Everyone was happy...

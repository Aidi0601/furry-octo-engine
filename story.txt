There is a very old village at the small island called popocaca. A furry bear, bobola, is a teacher at the local school. One day, the fifth graders were having a sports party. Of course, they were all Cubs and Bears fans.  At this party, they made baseball decorated cupcakes and had a football-shaped pie.  All of the bears had a great time. However, the day was ruined when later that night the Bears were defeated by the Packers.
The bears were so mad that they decided to take a boat to Wisconsin and burn all the cheese! The Packers, without their cheese, starved to death. The Bears, finally victorious, danced on the graves of their now-dead rivals. Everyone was happy...
As what you wished, thousand of zombies came out from the graves. They looked like lions, tigers, monkeys, and Donald Trump. They were slowly walking, twisting their bodies, laughing and talking about the stock market crash last week. Bears were scared by this situation. At that moment, some bear's phone rang. He picked it up and listened to it for a while and said, "call you back later mom, I am facing a bunch of zombies!"
